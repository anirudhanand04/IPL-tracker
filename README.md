Utilized RESTful APIs for efficient data exchange between frontend and backend.
Built a robust user registration and login system with encrypted password storage using BCrypt.
Applied reactive programming with WebClient for non-blocking API calls and improved performance.
Ensured modular code structure with service, controller, and repository layers for maintainability and scalability.
Wrote comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure application reliability.
Deployed the application locally and troubleshooted issues related to dependency injection and bean lifecycle in Spring.
